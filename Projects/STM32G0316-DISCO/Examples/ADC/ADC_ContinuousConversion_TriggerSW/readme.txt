@par Example Description
This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral to
perform conversions in continuous mode.

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in continuous conversion mode,
from SW trigger.

Example execution:
After the first trigger (software start in this example), following ADC conversions
are launched successively automatically, indefinitely.
With data overwrite functionality enabled, ADC is continuously updating the ADC conversion data register.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values
 
Connection needed:
None.
Note: Optionally, a voltage can be supplied to the analog input pin (cf pin below),
      between 0V and Vdda=3.3V, to perform a ADC conversion on a determined
      voltage level.
      Otherwise, this pin can be let floating (in this case ADC conversion data 
      value will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for LED
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA2 (breakable module pin 4 (or connector CN4 pin 4))

Board settings:
 - ADC is configured to convert ADC_CHANNEL_2.
 - The voltage input on ADC channel must be provided by an external source connected to the selected GPIO analog input (breakable module pin 4 (or connector CN3 pin 4)).


To observe voltage level applied on ADC channel through GPIO, connect a voltmeter on
pin PA2 (breakable module pin 4 (or connector CN4 pin 4)).

STM32G0316-DISCO board LED is be used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED2 is toggling after each data read
 - Error: In case of other errors, LED2 is toggling twice at a frequency of 1Hz.
