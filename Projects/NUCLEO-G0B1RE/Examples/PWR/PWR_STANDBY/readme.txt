@par Example Description

How to enter the Standby mode and wake up from this mode by using an external
reset or the WKUP pin.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 64 MHz, an EXTI line
is connected to the User push-button thrum PC.13 and configured to generate an
interrupt on falling edge.
The SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms and in the SysTick
interrupt handler, LED4 is toggled in order to indicate whether the MCU is in Standby or Run mode.

When a falling edge is detected on the EXTI line, an interrupt is generated and the system wake up,
the program then checks and clears the standby flag.
After clearing the standby flag, the software enables wake-up pin PWR_WAKEUP_PIN2 connected to PC.13, then 
the corresponding flag indicating that a wakeup event was received from the PWR_WAKEUP_PIN2 is cleared.
Finally, the system enters again Standby mode causing LED4 to stop toggling.

Next, the user can wake-up the system in pressing the User push-button which is connected
to the wake-up pin PWR_WAKEUP_PIN2.
A falling edge on WKUP pin will wake-up the system from Standby.
Alternatively, an external RESET of the board will lead to a system wake-up as well.

After wake-up from Standby mode, program execution restarts in the same way as after
a RESET and LED4 restarts toggling.

LED4 is used to monitor the system state as follows:
 - LED4 toggling: system in Run mode
 - LED4 off : system in Standby mode
 - LED4 ON: configuration failed (system will go to an infinite loop)

@note To measure the current consumption in Standby mode, remove JP3 jumper
      and connect an amperemeter to JP3 to measure IDD current.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G0B1RETx devices

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-G0B1RE
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-G0B1RE Set-up
    - LED4 connected to PA.05 pin
    - User push-button connected to pin PC.13 (EXTI_Line4_15)
    - WakeUp Pin PWR_WAKEUP_PIN2 connected to PC.13

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
