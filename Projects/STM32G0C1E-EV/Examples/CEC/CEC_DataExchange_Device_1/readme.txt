@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure and use the CEC peripheral to receive and 
transmit messages.


- Hardware Description

To use this example, two STM32G0C1E-EV boards (called Device_1 and 
Device_2) are loaded with the matching software then connected through CEC lines
(PB10 or HDMI connectors) and GND.

- Software Description

The test unrolls as follows.

On TX side, four possible messages can be transmitted and are indicated as
below on the transmitting board:
 - when Tamper push-button is pressed, LED1 toggles
 - when Joystick Selection push-button is pressed, LED2 toggles
 - when Joystick UP push-button is pressed, LED3 toggles
 - when Joystick DOWN push-button is pressed, LED4 toggles

Accordingly, the following happens on the RX side in case of successful
reception:
- when Tamper push-button is pressed on TX side, 
     * all RX side LEDs are turned off 
 - when Joystick Selection push-button is pressed on TX side, on RX side
     *  LED1 and LED2 are turned on
     *  LED3 and LED4 are turned off 
 - when Joystick UP push-button is pressed on TX side, 
     *  all RX side LEDs are turned on
 - when Joystick DOWN push-button is pressed on TX side, on RX side 
     * LED1 and LED2 are turned off
     * LED3 and LED4 are turned on    
In case of unsuccessful reception, LED3 is turned on.

Practically, 2 EXTI lines (EXTI_Line0_1 and EXTI_Line2_3) are configured to 
generate an interrupt on each falling or rising edge. 
A specific message is then transmitted by the CEC IP
and a LED connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled.
    - EXTI_Line0_1 is mapped to PA.00
    - EXTI_Line2_3 is mapped to PC.13, PC.02 and PC.03 

Then, on TX side,
  - when rising edge is detected on EXTI_Line0_1, LED2 toggles
  - when falling edge is detected on EXTI_Line4_15 and EXTI line interrupt is detected
    on PC.13, LED1 toggles
  - when falling edge is detected on EXTI_Line2_3 and EXTI line interrupt is detected
    on PC.02, LED3 toggles
  - when falling edge is detected on EXTI_Line2_3 and EXTI line interrupt is detected
    on PC.03, LED4 toggles
   

In this example, HCLK is configured at 64 MHz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G0C1VETx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32G0C1E-EV board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.      


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files (CEC_DataExchange_Device_1 project) and load your image into target memory
    o Load the project in Device_1 Board
 - Rebuild all files (CEC_DataExchange_Device_2 project) and load your image into target memory
    o Load the project in Device_2 Board
 - With a wire, connect PB10-PB10 between the 2 boards
 - Add a pullup resistor of 27kohm between PB10 and V3.3
 - Connect the ground of the 2 boards
 - Run the example
