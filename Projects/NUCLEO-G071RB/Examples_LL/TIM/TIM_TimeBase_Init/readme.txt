@par Example Description

Configuration of the TIM peripheral to generate a timebase. This 
example is based on the STM32G0xx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization 
uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size). 

   In this example TIM1 input clock TIM1CLK is set to APB2 clock (PCLK2),   
   since APB2 pre-scaler is equal to 1.
      TIM1CLK = PCLK2
      PCLK1 = HCLK
      => TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock (56 MHz)

To set the TIM1 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is calculated as follows:
PSC = (TIM1CLK / TIM1 counter clock) - 1
PSC = (SystemCoreClock /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 56 MHz for STM32G0xx Devices.

The auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a timebase period of 100ms,
meaning that initial timebase frequency is 10 Hz.
ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / timebase frequency) - 1
ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / 10) - 1

Update interrupts are enabled. Within the update interrupt service routine, pin LED4
(connected to LED4 on board NUCLEO-G071RB) is toggled. So the period of
blinking of LED4 = 2 * timebase period.

User push-button can be used to modify the timebase period from 100 ms
to 1 s in 100 ms steps. To do so, every time User push-button is pressed, the
autoreload register (ARR) is updated. In up-counting update event is generated 
at each counter overflow (when the counter reaches the auto-reload value). 

Finally the timebase frequency is calculated as follows:
timebase frequency = TIM1 counter clock /((PSC + 1)*(ARR + 1)*(RCR + 1))
