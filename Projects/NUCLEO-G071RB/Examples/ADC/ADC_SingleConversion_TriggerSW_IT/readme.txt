@par Example Description
Use ADC to convert a single channel at each SW start, 
conversion performed using programming model: interrupt 

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
ADC interruption enabled: EOC (end of conversion of ADC group regular).

Example execution:
The ADC performs 1 conversion of the selected channel. When conversion is completed,
ADC interruption occurs. IRQ handler callback function reads conversion data from
ADC data register and stores it into a variable, LED4 is turned on.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values

Connection needed:
None, if ADC channel and DAC channel are selected on the same GPIO.
Otherwise, connect a wire between DAC channel output and ADC input.

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for LED
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA4 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)
  DAC
  1 GPIO for DAC channel output PA4 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)
  1 GPIO for push button

Board settings:
 - ADC is configured to convert ADC_CHANNEL_4 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32).
 - The voltage input on ADC channel is provided from DAC (DAC_CHANNEL_1).
   ADC input from pin PA4 and DAC output to pin PA4:
   If same pin is used no connection is required, it is done internally. Otherwise, user need to connect a wire between Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32 and Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32
 - Voltage is increasing at each click on User push-button, from 0 to maximum range in 4 steps.
   Clicks on User push-button follow circular cycles: At clicks counter maximum value reached, counter is set back to 0.


To observe voltage level applied on ADC channel through GPIO, connect a voltmeter on
pin PA4 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32).

NUCLEO-G071RB board LED is be used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED4 is turned-on/off in function of ADC conversion
   result.
    - "On" upon conversion completion
    - "Off" during conversion
 - Error: In case of error, LED4 is toggling twice at a frequency of 1Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32GO71xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-G071RB board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
