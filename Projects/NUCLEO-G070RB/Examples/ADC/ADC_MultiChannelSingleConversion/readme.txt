@par Example Description
Use ADC to convert a several channels using sequencer in discontinuous mode, 
conversion data are transferred by DMA into an array, indefinitely (circular mode).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a three channels (one external analog, 2 internals),
in sequence conversion mode, one by one from SW trigger.
DMA is configured to transfer conversion data in an array, in circular mode.

Example execution:
From the start, the ADC converts the selected channels in sequence, one by one
(discontinuous mode) at each trig from User push-button click.
DMA transfers conversion data to the array, DMA transfer complete interruption occurs.
Results array is updated indefinitely (DMA in circular mode).
LED4 is turned on when the DMA transfer is completed (results array full)
and turned off at next DMA half-transfer (result array first half updated).
Note: If DMA buffer is full when user click on User push-button, the buffer is reset
(to ease user observe behavior).

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "aADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data (array of data)

Connection needed:

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for LED
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA4 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)
  1 GPIO for push button
  DMA

Board settings:
 - ADC is configured to convert one external channel ADC_CHANNEL_4
   (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32) and the two internal ones ADC_CHANNEL_VREFINT,
   ADC_CHANNEL_TEMPSENSOR.
  #error No ADC input configuration specified for GENERATOR!



NUCLEO-G070RB board LED is be used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED4 is turned-on/off in function of ADC conversion
   result.
    - Toggling: "On" upon conversion completion (full DMA buffer filled)
                "Off" upon half conversion completion (half DMA buffer filled)
 - Error: In case of error, LED4 is toggling twice at a frequency of 1Hz.
