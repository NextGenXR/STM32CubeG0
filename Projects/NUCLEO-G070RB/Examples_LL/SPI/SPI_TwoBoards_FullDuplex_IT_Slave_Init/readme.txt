@par Example Description 

Data buffer transmission and receptionvia SPI using Interrupt mode. This 
example is based on the STM32G0xx SPI LL API. The peripheral 
initialization uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

The communication is done with 2 boards through SPI.

This example shows how to configure GPIO and SPI peripherals
to use a Full-Duplex communication using IT mode through the STM32G0xx COM_INSTANCE1_TYPE LL API.

This example is split in two projects, Master board and Slave board:

- Master Board
  SPI1 Peripheral is configured in Master mode.
  SPI1_IRQn activated. 
  RXNE and TXE Interrupts SPI peripheral activated.
  GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 
  
- Slave Board
  SPI1 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode.
  SPI1_IRQn activated. 
  RXNE and TXE Interrupts SPI peripheral activated.


Example execution:
On BOARD MASTER, LED4 is blinking Fast (200ms) and wait User push-button action.
Press User push-button on BOARD MASTER start a Full-Duplex communication through IT.
On MASTER side, Clock will be generated on SCK line, Transmission(MOSI Line) and reception (MISO Line) 
will be done at the same time. 
SLAVE SPI will received  the Clock (SCK Line), so Transmission(MISO Line) and reception (MOSI Line) will be done also.

LED4 is On on both boards if data is well received.

In case of errors, LED4 is blinking Slowly (1s).

@note You need to perform a reset on Master board, then perform it on Slave board
      to have the correct behaviour of this example.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on NUCLEO-G070RB devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-G070RB board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-G070RB Set-up
    - Connect Master board PB3 to Slave Board PB3 (connected to pin 31 of CN10 connector)
    - Connect Master board PB4 to Slave Board PB4 (connected to pin 27 of CN10 connector)
    - Connect Master board PB5 to Slave Board PB5 (connected to pin 29 of CN10 connector)
    - Connect Master board GND to Slave Board GND

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
    o Load the Master project in Master Board
    o Load the Slave project in Slave Board
 - Run the example
